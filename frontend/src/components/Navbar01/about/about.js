    <h4>Our journey of building India's biggest unicorn
start-up has been full of successes, but also failures
and learning from them. That's why there's calculated
risk-taking, a high willingness to learn and improvise,
and a growth orientation built into everything we do.
Whether it be opening a new warehouse, or making
our mobile app a bit more consumer friendly, we're
always experimenting, learning and growing! </h4>
